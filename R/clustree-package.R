#' Clustree
#'
#' Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when
#' approaching a clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to
#' look at how samples move as the number of clusters increases. This package
#' allows you to produce clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating
#' clusterings as resolution increases.
