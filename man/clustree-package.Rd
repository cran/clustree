\description{
Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when
approaching a clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to
look at how samples move as the number of clusters increases. This package
allows you to produce clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating
clusterings as resolution increases.
