  title    = "{Clustering trees: a visualization for evaluating clusterings at
              multiple resolutions}",
  author   = "Zappia, Luke and Oshlack, Alicia",
  abstract = "Clustering techniques are widely used in the analysis of large
              datasets to group together samples with similar properties. For
              example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell
              RNA-sequencing in order to identify different cell types present
              in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing
              clustering, and the results can vary substantially. In
              particular, the number of groups present in a dataset is often
              unknown, and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm
              can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine
              the impact of varying clustering resolution, we present
              clustering trees. This visualization shows the relationships
              between clusters at multiple resolutions, allowing researchers to
              see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In
              addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform
              the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters.
              We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of
              simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris
              dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.
              Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package,
              available from CRAN and developed on GitHub.",

  author   = "Sugiyama, K and Tagawa, S and Toda, M",
  abstract = "Two kinds of new methods are developed to obtain effective
              representations of hierarchies automatically: theoretical and
              heuristic methods. The methods determine the positions of
              vertices in two steps. First the order of the vertices in each
              level is determined to reduce the number of crossings of edges.
              Then horizontal positions of the vertices are determined to
              improve further the readability of drawings. The theoretical
              methods are useful in recognizing the nature of the problem, and
              the heuristic methods make it possible to enlarge the size of
              hierarchies with which we can deal. Performance tests of the
              heuristic methods and several applications are presented.",

@ARTICLE{Reingold1981-iy,

  author   = "Reingold, E M and Tilford, J S",
  abstract = "Various algorithms have been proposed for producing tidy drawings
              of trees--drawings that are aesthetically pleasing and use
              minimum drawing space. We show that these algorithms contain some
              difficulties that lead to aesthetically unpleasing, wider than
              necessary drawings. We then present a new algorithm with
              comparable time and storage requirements that produces tidier
              drawings. Generalizations to forests and m-ary trees are
              discussed, as are some problems in discretization when
              alphanumeric output devices are used.",
